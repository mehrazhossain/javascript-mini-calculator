# javascript-mini-calculator
Mini JavaScript calculator using HTML, CSS, JavaScript &amp; DOM Manipulation.

How did I design this mini calculator's frontend?
1. I took out the calculator sample from Google.
2. First I created a section that I treated like an HTML Body tag.
3. Div Container, basically I put the whole calculator structure inside this div.
4. Inside the div container, there are 2 parts ⅰ.Display div
  ⅱ.key-pad div.
5. This is where CSS apply started.
